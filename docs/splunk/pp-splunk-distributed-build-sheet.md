# Distributed Splunk + Enterprise Security — PowerPlant Build Sheet

**Subsystem:** SIEM — indexer cluster, dedicated ES search head, management tier
**Enclave:** `security` — PP-Security `172.16.9.0/24` (gw `172.16.9.1`, `pp-internal-router`)
**Management:** all hosts dual-homed onto `10.255.240.0/20`; `ansible_host` is the mgmt IP
**Deployment:** 100% Ansible, blueprint-driven and hands-off
**Supersedes:** the single-instance `pp-splunk` running indexer + search head + Enterprise Security on one VM

**This is a MIGRATION, not an addition.** PowerPlant already runs Enterprise Security — `arbitr_pp_playbook.yaml` applies both `splunk` and `splunk-es` to `hosts: splunk`. Everything below splits three roles that currently share one box.

**This sheet is a plan. Nothing in it is built.**

---

## 1. What is different about PowerPlant

Two differences from the airfield sheet, and both cut in PowerPlant's favour.

**ES is already deployed and already sourced offline.** `roles/splunk-es` installs from `{{ ansible_installers }}/splunk/splunk-es.spl` and a directory of apps at `{{ ansible_installers }}/splunk/apps/*.tg*`, with `ansible_installers` = `/var/share/installers/` — pre-staged on the controller image. **The gating artifact problem in the airfield sheet (§8 there) does not exist here.** It is already solved, and this is the proven pattern airfield should copy rather than inventing a Nexus dependency.

**The variable migration is far simpler.** `splunk_server_ip` has exactly one functional consumer — `roles/splunk-forwarder/templates/outputs.conf.j2`. Airfield additionally derives `wazuh_manager_ip` from it, which PowerPlant does not. Nothing else silently follows a change.

**But one thing cuts against it: PowerPlant has ONE analyst workstation.** `[hunt]` contains `win-hunt-1` and nothing else. The ">10 concurrent analysts" driver that justifies a dedicated ES search head is not currently true here — see §11, decision 1. The ES-isolation argument stands on its own; the *sizing* argument does not, yet.

---

## 2. Host inventory

| Host | Role | PP-Security | mgmt | vCPU / RAM / disk | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pp-splunk` | **ES search head** (dedicated) | 172.16.9.20 | 10.255.240.175 | 32 / 64 GB / 300 GB | **exists** — role changes, address unchanged |
| `pp-splunk-idx01` | Indexer, cluster peer | 172.16.9.21 | 10.255.240.209 | 16 / 32 GB / 1 TB | new |
| `pp-splunk-idx02` | Indexer, cluster peer | 172.16.9.22 | 10.255.240.210 | 16 / 32 GB / 1 TB | new |
| `pp-splunk-cm` | Cluster manager + license manager + deployment server + monitoring console | 172.16.9.23 | 10.255.240.211 | 8 / 16 GB / 100 GB | new |

**Addressing.** PP-Security currently uses `.1` (`pp-internal-router`), `.11` (`win-hunt-1`), `.20` (`pp-splunk`), and `.30/.35/.40–.42` (the Security Onion grid). `.21`–`.29` are free and contiguous. Management continues at `.209` — current high-water is `.208`.

`pp-splunk` keeps `172.16.9.20` deliberately: it is the analyst-facing address and `splunk_server_ip` currently points at it. What changes is what that address *means* — see §5.

---

## 3. Why split, given ES is already running

The single instance is indexer **and** search head **and** ES host. Those three have conflicting resource profiles, and ES is the one that loses:

- ES ships 100+ correlation searches on schedules. `max_searches_perc` reserves 50% of search concurrency for scheduled work, so on a combined box those compete directly with both ad-hoc analyst search *and* the indexing pipeline.
- **CIM data model acceleration runs on the indexing tier** and is typically the dominant load in an ES deployment — more than ingest. On a combined instance it competes with the searches it exists to serve.
- A single indexer means no replication. Losing it loses the data.

Splitting gives ES a search head whose scheduled work does not contend with indexing, and spreads acceleration across two peers.

**Two indexers, RF=2 / SF=2.** A third becomes worthwhile past a few hundred GB/day, which this range is nowhere near.

**One management node carrying four roles.** Cluster manager, license manager, deployment server and monitoring console are all light singletons. Splitting them costs three more VMs that must come up unattended and buys nothing here.

**No search head cluster.** The textbook answer above ~10 analysts is a 3-member SHC. Against it: ES on SHC requires the deployer with a fiddly app-deployment path, it triples ES-sized hardware, and it adds captain election and artifact replication to a deploy that runs with nobody at a keyboard. A search head failure in a training range is a restart, not an outage. **Revisit** when investigations must survive a search head failure, or concurrency passes ~20 analysts.

**Concurrency arithmetic** — `base_max_searches (6) + max_searches_per_cpu (1) × cores`, with 50% reserved for scheduled work:

| cores | total | scheduled (ES) | ad-hoc | analysts at ~1.5 concurrent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 22 | 11 | 11 | 7 |
| 24 | 30 | 15 | 15 | 10 |
| **32** | **38** | **19** | **19** | **12–13** |

**With one hunt box today, 16 cores is sufficient.** 32 is sized for the stated future. Choosing between them is decision 1.

---

## 4. Blueprint additions

Three new VMs. `pp-splunk` **is** explicitly sized today at 16 vCPU / 32 GB — `docs/security-onion/blueprint-additions.yml` records `so-manager` as "sized to match pp-splunk" at those values. (Airfield's equivalent had no `cpuCount`/`memory` at all and silently inherited the image default; PowerPlant does not have that problem.)

The ready-to-apply version of this section is `docs/splunk/blueprint-additions.yml`.

```yaml
# MODIFY — pp-splunk becomes the dedicated ES search head
- type: "range.resource.primitive.VmInstance::1.0.0"
  name: "pp-splunk"
  properties:
    cpuCount: 32                      # currently 16 — see decision 1
    memory: "65536"
    networkInterfaces:
    - name: "pp-security"
      ipAddress: "172.16.9.20"        # unchanged
      prefix: 24
    managementInterface:
      ipAddress: "10.255.240.175"     # unchanged
      position: "FIRST"

# NEW — indexer cluster peers
- type: "range.resource.primitive.VmInstance::1.0.0"
  name: "pp-splunk-idx01"
  properties:
    cpuCount: 16
    memory: "32768"
    networkInterfaces:
    - name: "pp-security"
      ipAddress: "172.16.9.21"
      prefix: 24
    managementInterface:
      ipAddress: "10.255.240.209"
      position: "FIRST"

- type: "range.resource.primitive.VmInstance::1.0.0"
  name: "pp-splunk-idx02"
  properties:
    cpuCount: 16
    memory: "32768"
    networkInterfaces:
    - name: "pp-security"
      ipAddress: "172.16.9.22"
      prefix: 24
    managementInterface:
      ipAddress: "10.255.240.210"
      position: "FIRST"

# NEW — management tier
- type: "range.resource.primitive.VmInstance::1.0.0"
  name: "pp-splunk-cm"
  properties:
    cpuCount: 8
    memory: "16384"
    networkInterfaces:
    - name: "pp-security"
      ipAddress: "172.16.9.23"
      prefix: 24
    managementInterface:
      ipAddress: "10.255.240.211"
      position: "FIRST"
```

Use the same image the existing SO grid nodes run, for consistency with what the platform has proven on this range.

**Indexer disk is retention-driven and 1 TB is a placeholder** until a retention window is chosen (decision 2).

## 5. Inventory, group_vars, host_vars

`splunk_server_ip` is `172.16.9.20` at line 21 of `group_vars/all.yml` (on `main`) or
`group_vars/all/main.yml` (on `security-onion` — the branches diverge here) and means
"the indexer". After the split, `.20` receives nothing.

```yaml
# group_vars/all.yml on main, group_vars/all/main.yml on security-onion
splunk_indexers:                        # NEW — the receiving tier
  - "172.16.9.21"
  - "172.16.9.22"
splunk_forwarder_port: "9997"
splunk_search_head_ip: "172.16.9.20"    # NEW — analyst-facing, receives nothing
splunk_cluster_manager_ip: "172.16.9.23"
splunk_replication_port: "9887"
splunk_rf: 2
splunk_sf: 2
# splunk_server_ip: RETIRED — migrate its one consumer deliberately rather
# than redefining it, so nothing inherits the old meaning by accident.
```

Only one functional consumer to migrate: `roles/splunk-forwarder/templates/outputs.conf.j2`, which renders `server = {{ splunk_server_ip }}:{{ splunk_forwarder_port }}` and a matching `[tcpout-server://…]` stanza. Both become the indexer list. `roles/splunk-forwarder/README.md` also references the variable and should be updated so it stops documenting the retired name.

**Prefer indexer discovery** via the cluster manager over the static list, so a third indexer later needs no forwarder change.

New groups:

```ini
[splunk_search_head]
pp-splunk

[splunk_indexer]
pp-splunk-idx01
pp-splunk-idx02

[splunk_cluster_manager]
pp-splunk-cm

[splunk_cluster:children]
splunk_search_head
splunk_indexer
splunk_cluster_manager
```

`[splunk-forwarder:children]` enumerates `domain_controllers`, `corporate_servers`, `dmz` and `workstations`, so the new Splunk hosts are **not** in it — good. Confirm none of them land in those groups when added, or they will forward to themselves.

The six `win-hunt-*` boxes **are** direct members of `[splunk-forwarder]` as of 2026-08-17, alongside `pp-proxy`. They are deliberately *not* in `[workstations]`: that group means "the simulated business's user endpoints", and while it feeds nothing but the forwarder group today, a future play targeting it for scenario activity or attack simulation should not silently include the blue team's own tooling.

---

## 6. Existing indexed data

`pp-splunk` currently holds every indexed bucket. After the split it is a search head and stores none.

For a range rebuilt between exercises this is a non-issue — a fresh deploy starts empty either way. **If this migration is ever applied to a running range with data worth keeping**, the buckets on `pp-splunk` do not move by themselves and become unsearchable. Either accept the loss, or plan a bucket migration separately; it is not in scope here.

The existing indexes (`windows`, `sysmon`, `linux`, `netfw`, `proxy`, `mail`) must be created **on the peers via the cluster manager's `manager-apps`**, not by editing peers directly. ES adds its own (`notable`, `risk`, `threat_activity`, …) the same way.

---

## 7. Roles

| Role | Runs on | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `splunk_cluster_manager` | `splunk_cluster_manager` | installs Splunk, cluster-manager mode with RF/SF, license manager, MC, deployment server |
| `splunk_indexer` | `splunk_indexer` | installs Splunk, joins as peer, enables receiving on 9997, license peer |
| `splunk_search_head` | `splunk_search_head` | installs Splunk, joins the CM as a search head, license peer |
| `splunk-es` (existing) | `splunk_search_head` | **mostly unchanged** — already installs from pre-staged artifacts; only its target group changes |
| `splunk_cim` | SH + peers via CM | CIM add-on, TAs, enable chosen accelerated data models |
| `splunk` (existing) | — | **narrow or retire** — it currently does single-instance indexer + search head |
| `splunk-forwarder` (existing) | unchanged | only its `outputs.conf` target changes |

`pass4SymmKey` and the cluster secret into `group_vars/all/vault.yml` beside the existing Splunk credentials.

---

## 8. Deployment order

1. **Cluster manager** — must exist before any peer can join
2. **Indexers** — join the cluster, enable receiving
3. **Search head** — connects to the CM as a search head
4. **ES** on the search head (existing role, retargeted)
5. **Indexes app pushed to peers via the CM** — both the range's six and ES's own
6. **CIM add-on and TAs**, then enable acceleration
7. **Forwarders repointed** to the indexers
8. **Verification** (§10)

Steps 5 and 7 are the ones most often got wrong: pushing indexes to peers by hand instead of through the cluster manager, and repointing forwarders before the indexers are receiving.

---

## 9. CIM normalization — still the larger half

ES is installed here, but **ES correlation searches fire off accelerated data models, not raw events.** Whether PowerPlant's data is CIM-compliant today is unverified and should be checked before assuming the split alone improves anything:

```
| tstats count from datamodel=Authentication where nodename=Authentication by sourcetype
```

If that returns little or nothing, the models are not being populated and ES has been generating few notables regardless of hardware.

Required add-ons: `Splunk_TA_nix`, `Splunk_TA_windows`, a Sysmon TA. pfSense and VyOS have no first-party TA and need sourcetype definitions written — note that `netfw` is listed as "currently unused; reserved for pfsense/vyatta syslog when wired up", so that feed may not exist yet at all.

Accelerate only the models the scenarios exercise — Authentication, Network_Traffic, Endpoint, Malware, Web. Every accelerated model is continuous indexer load, and the default set is larger than what this range feeds.

**The range currently accelerates 16 of 17 models.** `roles/splunk-es` writes `Splunk_SA_CIM/local/datamodels.conf` from `range-development-ansible/templates/splunkapps/cim-datamodels.conf.j2`; only `Alerts` is off, and 13 of the 16 omit `acceleration.manual_rebuilds`, so they rebuild automatically rather than only building forward.

Measured 2026-08-17: nine models held zero bytes, every model reported
`is_inprogress=0`, and all summaries together were ~7 MB. An IOWait alert on
the live instance turned out to be post-deploy startup load, not acceleration.

**But that sample was taken with the emulated users OFF**, so it does not
establish which models are genuinely unfed. Several that read as empty —
Web, Email, Network_Resolution, and more of Endpoint — plausibly populate
once `[ae]`/`[aue]` are running and simulated users start browsing, mailing
and logging in.

**Do not trim acceleration based on an idle-range observation.** Re-check
after emulation has been running long enough to be representative, then trim
what is still empty. Trimming now risks disabling a model that would have had
a feed, which is a worse failure than leaving a few empty ones scanning.

---

## 10. Acceptance tests

Each asserts an **outcome**, not that a service is running. Six defects in this project have come from checks that measured the transport and reported it as the outcome; see `UPSTREAM_FIXES.md`.

| # | Test | Pass |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `splunk show cluster-status` on the CM | all peers Up, **search factor met**, replication factor met |
| 2 | `| rest /services/search/distributed/peers` on the SH | both indexers, status `Up` |
| 3 | Ingest reaches **both** peers | `| tstats count where index=* by splunk_server` returns both, non-zero |
| 4 | A UF on an arbitrary host | `splunk list forward-server` shows both indexers active |
| 5 | Indexes exist **on the peers** | the six range indexes plus ES's, present on both, pushed via CM |
| 6 | Data model acceleration progressing | each enabled model >0% and advancing between two samples |
| 7 | **ES generates notables** | `index=notable` non-zero within 24h — the test that proves ES is wired to the data |
| 8 | Concurrency headroom under load | ad-hoc slots remaining |

Test 7 is the one that matters. Tests 1–6 can all pass while ES produces nothing, because they verify plumbing and ES fires off *models*.

## 11. Open decisions

1. ~~**Analyst count**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-17:** `pp-splunk` resized to 32 vCPU / 64 GB, and `[hunt]` grown from one workstation to six (`win-hunt-1`..`6`, `172.16.9.11`–`.16`). All six are now in `[members]` and domain-joined — `win-hunt-1` never had been. Six analyst workstations does not yet reach ">10 concurrent analysts", so the search head sizing still carries headroom beyond present need; adding `win-hunt-7`..`12` at `.17`–`.19` and `.24`–`.26` would close that gap.
2. **Retention window** — drives indexer disk; 1 TB is a placeholder. **Measured on the live single instance 2026-08-17**, which narrows this considerably:

   | | |
   |---|---|
   | steady-state write rate | ~1.1 MB/s (22,672 sectors / 10 s) |
   | steady-state read rate | ~0 |
   | platform default disk | **178 MB/s** sequential write, `dd` 512 MB direct |
   | all CIM summaries combined | ~7 MB |
   | `vmstat wa` | 0 |

   **THESE ARE A FLOOR, NOT A STEADY STATE.** The emulated users (`[ae]` on
   the servers, `[aue]` on the workstations) were **not enabled** when this was
   sampled, and they are the range's primary traffic generator — simulated
   logons, file access, browsing and mail are exactly what feed Authentication,
   Web, Endpoint and Change. Expect materially more once emulation runs; how
   much more is unmeasured.

   What survives the caveat: the platform disk does **178 MB/s** against a
   measured **~1 MB/s**, so there is roughly two orders of magnitude of
   headroom before storage throughput is the binding constraint. That margin
   is wide enough that emulation is very unlikely to close it.

   What does NOT survive: any daily-volume figure, and therefore the retention
   sizing. **Re-measure with emulation enabled** before committing to indexer
   disk — that is the number decision 2 actually needs.

   Also note the ES-contention argument in §3 stands on its own and does not
   depend on ingest volume: correlation searches competing with indexing on a
   combined instance is a problem at any data rate. Do not lean on throughput
   either way until it has been measured properly.
3. **Which data models to accelerate** — §9 proposes five, contingent on the CIM check.
4. ~~**Is `netfw` wired up?**~~ — **PARTLY ANSWERED 2026-08-17** (with emulation off; see decision 2).** `group_vars` still describes `netfw` as "reserved for pfsense/vyatta syslog when wired up", but the Network_Traffic data model has **1 MB of accelerated summary on the live instance**, so something is populating it. Worth finding out what, and updating the group_vars comment, before assuming that model has no feed.
5. **Bucket migration** — only if this is ever applied to a range whose data matters (§6).

---

## 12. Build-time version checklist

- Splunk Enterprise — must match across CM, peers and SH; version skew between search head and peers is unsupported
- Splunk Enterprise Security — check the ES↔Enterprise compatibility matrix before pinning
- Splunk CIM add-on
- `Splunk_TA_nix`, `Splunk_TA_windows`, Sysmon TA
- Universal Forwarder — a UF newer than the indexers is unsupported

Record resolved versions here once chosen.
